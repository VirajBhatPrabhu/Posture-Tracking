# Posture-Tracking


[Link To The App](https://virajbhatprabhu.github.io/Posture-Tracking/) 

### Aim  of The Project
The Goal is to create a complete end-to-end Posture detection project using a pre-trained PoseNet model.


### What is PoseNet?
 Posenet is a deep learning TensorFlow model that allows you to estimate human pose by detecting body parts such as elbows, hips, wrists, knees, ankles, and form a skeleton structure of your pose by joining these points.

### How Do We Implement This Project

* Javascript was used as we had to do all the work in the browser
* We used P5.js, It is a javascript library used for creative coding
* We used PoseNet model which is present in the ML5.js library. It is the main library that consists of various deep learning models on which you can build projects
* The project was deployed on Github using Github Pages
